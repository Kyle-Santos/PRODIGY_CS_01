# PRODIGY_CS_01

## Caesar Cipher Python Program | Prodigy InfoTech Internship
This Python program implements a simple Caesar cipher, which is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Usage
Run the program.
Enter the text you want to encrypt.
The program will encrypt the text using the Caesar cipher and display the encrypted text.
It will then decrypt the encrypted text and display the decrypted text.

### Functions
encryptCaesarCipher(text): Encrypts the input text using the Caesar cipher.
decryptCaesarCipher(text): Decrypts the input text encrypted with the Caesar cipher.

This program only encrypts and decrypts letters. Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation) remain unchanged.
